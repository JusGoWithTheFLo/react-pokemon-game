# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Pokémon Love Game

This is a simple and fun Pokémon-themed game where you can capture, care for, and battle with Pokémon. The game allows you to interact with Pokémon by petting, feeding, hugging, or battling them. Each Pokémon starts with a set number of hearts that can be filled or reduced by your actions. You can encounter new Pokémon randomly and capture them to add to your collection.

## Features

- **Random Encounter**: Encounter and capture Pokémon from the first 151 Pokémon.
- **Hearts Mechanism**: Pokémon have hearts that can be filled or reduced through interactions (petting, feeding, hugging, battling).
- **Captured Pokémon List**: Keep track of your captured Pokémon and their hearts.
- **Battle and Adventure**: Battle with Pokémon or take them on adventures.
- **Pokémon Care**: Feed, pet, and hug your Pokémon to fill their hearts with love.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors when no hearts are left or when the Pokémon is already captured.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive UI components and managing the application state.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to fetch Pokémon data.
- **PokeAPI**: The public API to fetch information about the first 151 Pokémon.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
